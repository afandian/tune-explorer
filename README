Tune Explorer

An HTML interface to explore the tunes found in FolkTuneFinder, with an interactive tree of pitches.
This does requre the folktunefinder.com API to be available, so it's of limited use to others. I'm making it public because why not.

Written in CoffeeScript, as a learn-the-language exercise.
