Tune Explorer

An HTML5 / canvas interface to explore the tunes found in FolkTuneFinder, with an interactive tree of pitches.
This does requre the folktunefinder.com API to be available, so it's of limited use outside the folktunefinder.com website. I'm making it public because I think that anything involving code and music is interesting.

Written in CoffeeScript, as a learn-the-language exercise. Conclusion: I like coffeescript.
